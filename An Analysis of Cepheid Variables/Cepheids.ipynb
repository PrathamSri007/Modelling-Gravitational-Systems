    "# Cepheids\n",
    "\n",
    "Cepheids are a type of variable star that pulsate radially, varying in both diameter and temperature, which produces changes in brightness with a well-defined stable period and amplitude. These stars are significant in the field of astronomy for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standard Candles**: Cepheids have a well-established relationship between their luminosity and pulsation period, known as the Leavitt law or period-luminosity relation. This makes them excellent standard candles for measuring astronomical distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distance Measurement**: By observing the period of a Cepheid's brightness variations, astronomers can determine its absolute magnitude. Comparing this with the apparent magnitude allows for the calculation of the distance to the star, which is crucial for mapping the scale of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Galactic and Extragalactic Studies**: Cepheids are used to measure distances within our galaxy and to nearby galaxies. This helps in understanding the structure and scale of the Milky Way and the local group of galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Historical Importance**: The discovery of Cepheids in the Andromeda galaxy by Edwin Hubble was pivotal in establishing that the universe is expanding, leading to the formulation of the Big Bang theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cepheids continue to be a vital tool in modern astrophysics, aiding in the calibration of other distance measurement methods and contributing to our understanding of the cosmos."

    "##### The answer lies within a phenomenon called **κ–mechanism**.\n",
    "Cepheids change brightness due to the thermal instability caused by κ–mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Opacity is the measure of impenetrability to electromagnetic or other kinds of radiation. The kappa mechanism occurs when opacity in a star increases with temperature rather than decreasing. For example, doubly ionized helium has higher opacity than singly ionized helium.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The main gas thought to be involved in the process is helium. The kappa mechanism occurs in two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A) Compression Phase:\n",
    " When the star contracts, it temperature and density in the ionisation zone increases. This rise in temperature leads to a point where double ionisation occurs spontaneously and is sustained throughout the layer, eventually leading to higher opacity. High opacity traps the radiation within the ionization zone, causing it to heat up further and store energy. The increased thermal pressure pushes the outer layers outward, initiating the expansion phase. Cepheid variables become dimmest during the part of the cycle when the helium is doubly ionized.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### B) Expansion Phase:\n",
    "  As it expands, it cools, but remains ionised until another threshold is reached at which point double ionization cannot be sustained. Thereafter, helium ions recombine; the layer becomes singly ionized hence more transparent (i.e. opacity decreases), which allows radiation to escape. The reduced pressure slows and ultimately stops the expansion. Contraction begins due to the star's gravitational attraction.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The thermal instability arises because the energy trapping (during compression) and release (during expansion) are out of phase with the star's motion. This ensures that the pulsations are self-sustaining, as the trapped energy drives the outward motion and the energy release facilitates contraction.\n",
