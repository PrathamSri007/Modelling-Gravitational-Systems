# Modelling-Gravitational-Systems
KCAP Project 2024  
This is a project I took up under the Krittika Computational Astronomy Projects (KCAP) that were being organised by the Krittika Astronomy Club of IIT Bombay.  

There are two segments in this project work:  
### A) An Analysis of Cepheid Variables  
This is an analysis of cepheid variable stars, their mechanism of pulsations and an example of their usage in calculating distances on an astronomical scale.
### B) Modelling Gravitational Systems
Have you ever wondered how planets orbit stars, galaxies take shape, or why some celestial systems are orderly while others descend into chaos? This project focuses on computationally modelling gravitational systems using Python, PyTorch and Matplotlib. It also provides the functionality to generate contour plots of gravitational potential, offering insights into the spatial distribution of gravitational potential.
